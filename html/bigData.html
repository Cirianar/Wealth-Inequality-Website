        <h2>Why is wealth inequality increasing?</h2>
        <p>The rise in economic inequality in the U.S. and around the world is tied to several factors. These include, technological change, globalization, the decline of unions and the eroding value of the minimum wage. Many of these factors, especially economic ones, are tied to the ideology of neo-liberalism. Neoliberalism is contemporarily used to refer to market-oriented reform policies such as "eliminating price controls, deregulating capital markets, lowering trade barriers" and reducing, especially through privatization and austerity, state influence in the economy. The resurgence of neo-liberalism in the 80' with Ronald Reagan and Thatcher helped speed up the trend of wealth disparity between the ultra-rich and the poor 50%.</p>

        <h2>The issue of modern capitalism</h2>
        <p>Today, in the USA, the richest 1 per cent own 34 per cent of the wealth and the richest 10 per cent own 74 per cent of the wealth. In the UK, the richest 1 per cent own 12 per cent of the wealth and the richest 10 per cent own 44 per cent of the wealth. In France the figures are 24 cent and 62 per cent respectively. The richest 1 percent own 35 percent of the wealth in Switzerland, 24 per cent in Sweden and 15 percent in Canada. Although there are important variations, other developed countries show similar patterns of inequality within this range. All of these countries have a free market capitalist system. It can be concluded from this, and other data, that capitalism perpetuates a system of inequality. Wether it be imperialist segregation for forced capitalism, or moder slave labour through wage supression when labour laws are non existent, capitalism has helped increase wealth disparity.</p>

        <h2>What solutions are present?</h2>
        <p>Making tax rates more proggresive can help reduce inequality. It is a great irony that tax rates for those at the top have been declining even as their share of income and wealth has increased dramatically. The data show we have created bad tax policy by giving capital gains -- profits from the sale of property or investments -- special privileges in our country's tax code; privileges that give investment income more value than actual work. Capital gains tax rates must be adjusted so that they are in line with income tax rates. Savings incentives structured as refundable tax credits, which treat every dollar saved equally, can provide equal benefits for lower-income families.</p><br>
        <p>Governments around the world should provide the bottom two-fifths in terms of income, access to education and employment training. Investing in human capital is the best way to increase individual wealth and improve the labor force. Equity in education would bring everyone up to at least a minimum standard. It would be a better solution than increasing welfare benefits or providing a universal basic income as it breaks the poverty cycle once and for all.</p>

        <h2>How can I help?</h2>
        <p>individuals can help by donating to orginisations which help the poor (see <a href="contactUs.html">CONTACT US</a>). This would directly help those in need. Donating to charities which provide education for younger ones who can not afford it also addresses the solution of providing for the poor. To lobby for the government to change tax brackets, one can donate as a grass root doner to progressive political campaigns or parties such as Bernie Sanders in the USA or DIEM2024 in the EU.</address></p>
