        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <h4>Go vote</h4>
        <p>Although not a direct solution, this is one of the most important things to do regardless if you live in a backsliding democracy or not. Going out to vote can not only influence how your country is run but it can also be a strong statement to the people who currently run their country. In many authoritarian democracies such as Hungary and Poland, many democratic institutions have been subverted but the onet hing which has not been greatly affected are elections. Increasing turnout and ousting un-democratic parties is on of the best ways to fight back against these currents.</p>
        <h4>Collective action</h4>
        <p>Once a country becomes to authoriarian, and indirect forms of protest do not work anymore, direct action must b undertaken. Protesting, striking and boycotting are all effective methods to get a governing body to negotiate. However, this does not come without risks, the risk of imprisonment, harsh reprisals and violence.</p>
        <h4>Stronger international cooperation</h4>
        <p>Trans-national political unions such as the EU have the power to snaction and punish its members for disregarding democratic norms and freedoms. However since this requires a unanimous vote by all EU members this has mostly failed. By increasing ties within these regional and international unions more of these sanctions against undemocratic countries would be far easier.</p>
