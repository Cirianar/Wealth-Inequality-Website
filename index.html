        <h3>GINI Coefficient by Country (2020)</h3>
        <p id="info">The GINI Coefficient represents the statistical dispersion of wealth in a country, and not NET WEALTH. The data set used in this map is average income of households across each country. The Coefficient aims to represent wealth disparity and inequality. The higher the value for a country, the more in-equitous it is.</p>

        <h2>What is wealth inequality?</h2>
        <p>Income inequality is how unevenly income is distributed throughout a population. The less equal the distribution, the higher income inequality is. Income inequality is often accompanied by wealth inequality, which is the uneven distribution of wealth. Populations can be divided up in different ways to show different levels and forms of income inequality such as income inequality by sex or race. Different measures, such as the Gini coefficient, can be used to analyze the level of income inequality in a population. Income/wealth inequality can be caused by factor such as history (i.e slavery and gender imbalance), economic systems, decrease in labour rights or no social security.</p>
